        <iframe class="imgbox"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmS2-9KEeS0"></iframe>
   
    <p class="stxt"> Multi-paradigm programming is programming that enables distinct styles of programming to be implemented
        whether individually or blended together. Programming languages on the other hand, are categorized
        according to their paradigms such as imperative, functional and object-oriented.
        C++ is a multi-paradigm language because programmers are permitted to combine parts of programming
        approaches such as procedural programming or object-oriented programming.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Easier compared to other low-level languages</li>
        <li>II. Supports and allows user-defined operators such as Operator Overloading and function overloading</li>
        <li>III. Gives programmer complete control over the memory management</li>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. The concept of pointers used is hard to comprehend</li>
        <li>II. Have security concerns due to the existence of friend functions, global variables, and pointers</li>
        <li>III. Lack garbage collector feature to filter out unnecessary data automatically</li>

        <h5 class="stxt1">3 Criteria of Programming Paradigms in C++</h5>
        <!--iframe class="imgbox"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmS2-9KEeS0"></iframe> -->
        
        <h3 class="stxt">Imperative Programming in C++</h3>
   
    <p class="stxt">C++ is an imperative programming language that supports imperative paradigm.
        Imperative programming paradigm is one of the oldest programming paradigm and was developed
        using machine-languages.  A program based on this paradigm is made up of a <b>clearly-defined sequence of 
        instructions</b> to a computer. Therefore, the source code for imperative languages such as C++ is a series of commands,
        which specify the operations that the computer must complete to reach its final goal. The program describes steps 
        that change the computer's state of memory by providing statements. The state is represented by program variables
        where the values used in variables are changed at program runtime.</p>
     <!--example-->
        
    <h3 class="stxt">Advantages & Disadvantages of Imperative Programming</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Very simple to implement</li>
        <li>II. It contains loop</li>
        <li>III. Code is easy to understand</li>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. Complex problem can not be solved </li>
        <li>II.Higher risk of errors when editing </li>
        <li>III. Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </div>
    <br><br>
     <h3 class="stxt">Functional Programming in C++</h3>
   
    <p class="stxt">Functional progamming paradigm is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing
        functions. It is a <b>declarative programming</b> paradigm in which emphasize the definition of function that
        return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program. C++ is not a functional 
        programming language but it is a multi-paradigm programming language that <b>supports functional style programming</b>.</p>
        
        
     <p class="stxt">Functional programming in C++ allows creation of STL algorithm - a set of common algorithm pattern such as sorting and counting which allow 
        to pass custom functions without resorting to function pointers. The capability to pass functions as arguments to another function, 
        and to have functions that return new functions, made even the first standardized version of C++ a functional programming languages.
        The functional features of the languages are introduced in C++11 standard. Only the C++ compiler which supports the above standard can compile 
        and run the code.</p>
 <!--example-->
  
    <h3 class="stxt">Advantages & Disadvantages of Functional Programming</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Program are stateless</li>
        <li>II. Well-suited for parallelization</li>
        <li>III. Easily testable and debuggable</li>

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. Data cannot be changed </li>
        <li>II. Retrieval of large amounts of data not possible efficiently </li>
        <li>III. Recursive programming can lead to serious errors </li>
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <h3 class="stxt">Object-oriented Programming in C++</h3>
   
    <p class="stxt"> Object-oriented programming is a programming style that uses object to implement the real world entities like 
        <b>inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction</b> and more in programming. The main aim of Object-oriented programming is 
        to bind the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. In C++ languages,
        the building block that leads to Object-oriented programming is a <b>Class</b>. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and 
        member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an object or instance of that class. A Class in C++ is a <b>blue-print</b> representing 
        a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated
        where an object is created, memory is allocated.</p>
     <!--example-->
        
    <h3 class="stxt">Advantages & Disadvantages of Object-oriented Programming</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>I. Code is reusable</li>
        <li>II. Ensure data security</li>
        <li>III. Code is easy to maintain</li>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>I. It can cause duplication</li>
        <li>II. Large program size</li>
        <li>III. Not suitable for all types of problems</li>
